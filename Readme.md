# Speed Controller
This repository contains the source code for our custom speed controllers. More details will follow when this project exceeds the proof-of-concept state.


## TODO
- [x] Output PWM to FET's / H-Bridge
- [x] Read receiver signal
- [x] Proof of concept
- [ ] Verify RC Input signal, eg verify there is a 17.5-19.5ms time the pin is low
- [ ] Slow down motor response, to prevent magic smoke from exiting the FETs
- [ ] Make min/max pulse length user-configurable.
